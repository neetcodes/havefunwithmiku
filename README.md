# havefunwithmiku

So, I decided to recreate this thing in HTML.

It was made in a sudden urge to see how the app might have looked like, if I glued together the resources. (that have been made public recently, thanks to the efforts detailed in a Nick Robinson video on YouTube.)

This recreation is obviously unrelated to Domino's Japan. It has no intention to help you buy pizzas either. 

Unfortunately most functionality do not work yet. (>_<) (and it's pretty hard to replicate the AR features.) 

Try it here:

I recommend listening to the songs in the Miku Player(4th tab). You can change among the 4 songs by clicking on the status symbols on the top.

You can see the UI in Miku Park(3rd tab), and interact with it somewhat too. Try clicking "Pizza Stage LIVE". It's not the thing it should do, but I hope it entertains :).

First two tabs are placeholders.

All rights to the resources in this belong to their respective owners.
このアプリは実際のドミノ・ピザとは一切関係ありません。
