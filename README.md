# havefunwithmiku

So, I decided to recreate this thing in HTML.

It was made in a sudden urge to see how the app might have looked like, if I glued together the resources. (that have been made public recently, thanks to the efforts detailed in a Nick Robinson video on YouTube.)

This recreation is obviously unrelated to Domino's Japan. It has no intention to help you buy pizzas either. 

Unfortunately most functionality do not work yet. (>_<) (and it's pretty hard to replicate the AR features.) 

Try it here:

I recommend listening to the songs in the Miku Player. You can change among the 4 songs by clicking on the status symbols on the top.

このアプリは実際のドミノ・ピザとは一切関係ありません。
