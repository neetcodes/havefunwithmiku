So, I tried to recreate the Domino's Japan feat. Hatsune Miku iPhone app in HTML.

Try it here:
https://neetcodes.github.io/havefunwithmiku/

You might have to click once on anywhere on the page to make the splash play. And I guess you have to adjust your browser's zoom to make it fit your screen, because it has no scaling smarts.

I recommend listening to the songs in the Miku Player(4th tab). You can change among the 4 songs by clicking on the status symbols on the top.

You can see the UI in Miku Park(3rd tab), and interact with it somewhat too. Try clicking "Pizza Stage LIVE". It's not the thing it should do, but I hope it entertains. :)

First two tabs are placeholders.

If you want to read the code, which is short, the only file that is original is [`index.html`](https://github.com/neetcodes/havefunwithmiku/blob/main/index.html).

### Why I made this

It was made in a sudden urge to see how the app might have looked like, if I glued together the resources. They have been made public a while ago, thanks to the efforts detailed in a Nick Robinson video on YouTube.

This recreation is obviously unrelated to Domino's Japan. It has no intention to help you buy pizzas either. 

Unfortunately most functionality do not work yet. (>_<)
Also it's pretty hard to replicate the AR features. They use a very old version of Vuforia if I remember correctly. I'm not sure if the resources have the data to do the show either, but I know they have the pizza box recognition data.

All rights to the resources in this belong to their respective owners.
このアプリの再現は実際のドミノ・ピザとは一切関係ありません。
